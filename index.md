## Summary in 5 Bullet Points:
* Building assignments, courses & curricula **backwards**: from assessment methods to coverage and structure.
* Conceptualizing the **professional activity** (versus the subject matter) at the center of a topic/course/major/program. For example, teaching students to be writers or biologists, vs. teaching students writing or biology--independent of major.
* Identifying the crucial **threshold concepts** that distinguish the intellectual and/or applied work of a problem domain.
* Developing manageable but rich means of **authentic assessment** against threshold concepts, across varying types of assignments, from daily readings to major projects.
* Thinking about Vygotsky's **zone of proximal development**: establishing the appropriate conditions for learning within a particular zone/threshold.

## Threshold Concepts

**Definition:** "A threshold concept can be considered as akin to a portal, opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress." (Meyer & Land, 2003)

### Qualities of Threshold Concepts:
1. **Transformative**: Fundamentally change a way of thinking or performing with regard to a given problem in a disciplinary area.
2. **Irreversible**: Once acquired, threshold concepts can be rarely unlearned or forgotten.
3. **Integrative**: Threshold concepts connect previously disparate or apparently unrelated ideas, practices, theories, etc.
4. **Bounded**: Threshold concepts may not open up to mastery so much as to other conceptual thresholds that learners must cross.
5. **Troublesome**: Threshold concepts appear alien, counter-intuitive, and/or without organizing principle. They are difficult.
6. **Discursive**: Threshold concepts are attended by transformations in language: from command of technical terms to the ability to express, e.g., difficult theoretical/conceptual material.

### Difference from 'core' concepts
Core concepts represent the rudimentary skills/ideas inherent in a particular problem domain; they can be represented in handbooks, how-to guides, etc. For example, a grammatical concept like subject-verb agreement is a core concept in writing; however, mastery of subject-verb agreement does not fundamentally alter the way that students approach deeper and more global challenges in the activity of writing the way that, for example, writing for an authentic audience (e.g., other engineers) does.

## Authentic Assessment

**Definition:** Assessment conducted according to **task** for the student to perform and a **rubric** by which that task will be assessed. Threshold concepts can guide instructors (and students) as to the criteria by which a task is assessed.

### Difference from other traditional modes of assessment

|---
| **Traditional Assessment** | **Authentic Assessment**
|:-|:-
| Responding to a prompt | Defining & solving problems
| Artificially scaffolded | Real-life messiness
| Recall/Recognition | Construction/Application
| Teacher-structured | Problem-structured
| Evidence of knowledge acquisition through response | Evidence of performance through application
| Exposing comprehension  | Exposing process
| Core concepts | Threshold concepts
